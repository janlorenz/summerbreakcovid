Detailed project report

## Outline

The fate of a pandemic is determined by the reproductive number^[Need a definition here.]. Exponential growth or decline of new cases is determined by the reproductive number being above or below one. Small differences in environmental conditions, for example seasonality, can be important to make the difference. Also changes in daily behavior can make a difference. An interesting question is the effect of summer school vacation, because one may think of different consequences:

- During vacation kids are not in school as well as many of their parents who take holidays. This cuts off many daily channels of contagion. 
- On the other hand, families tend to travel during vacation which opens new channels of contagion through contacts while travelling or visits of relatives and friends. 

**Data**

Detailed data for Germany on regional units is availbel through the RKI
<https://github.com/robert-koch-institut/SARS-CoV-2-Infektionen_in_Deutschland_Archiv>.
Some wrangling is needed to format it properly but that should be feasible:

- Group by federal state
- Computation of moving weekly average per day

Data for the German summer school holidays is regionally different across the federal states of Germany which makes a nice natural setting to detangle the effect of vacation from the general trend of the pandemic. 

Need a nice data source or some handwork to read summer school vacations in. 




## Over all summer school vacations accelerates/decelerates contagio (TO BE ANSWERED) 


![A figure from an earlier analysis](img/draft.png){#fig-mainvisualization}

@fig-mainvisualization should communicate the general (average) answer. The current draft figure shows only the case numbers for one state compared to Germany's average trend. AIt also shows beginning and end of vacation. 


## Additional visualizations and further analyses with the data

Further analysis then should do: 

- discuss if the effect was different in 2020, 2021, and 2022
- discuss some cases especially those states who deviate from the average answer, what are potential reasons

## Conclusion

Discuss generalizability of results. Probably limited but possible if another pandemic has similar proporties. 


## Interactive Visualization / Data Dashboard {.appendix}

It should be possible to make a dashboard with selection of states and years and perhaps also some dynamic state rankings. 



## Data Source {.appendix}

Probably necessary.
