Detailed project report

*The following headlines are suggestions only.*

## Outline

*What questions will the report address and why?*

*How can data be accessed. Code for loading.*

*Information how data is collected. Who collects data.*

*Be very brief here, if necessary provide and refer to an appendix. You can also use footnotes.^[This is a footnote, which can be used for more information which maybe a reader.]*

Your report shall follow an "inverted pyramid" story format [see @Dykes2019EffectiveDataStorytelling] as shown in @fig-dykesstoryformats .

Remove all this text and put you content.^[Using this template is not mandatory.]

If the final report has sufficient quality, it can be published to the web directly from here, if you want. 
Also a check for copyright or data privacy violations is necessary.

## Main visualization of the data 

*Better give a more substantial title.*

This should present you main point visually with one (or more) figures.

```{r}
#| label: fig-mainvisualization
#| fig-cap: "The figure shows this ... (but is just a placeholder)."
mpg |> ggplot(aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_point()
```

@fig-mainvisualization shows the insight.

*Refer here to*

- *Additional visualizations and analysis below*
- *Interactive Visualization / Dashboard below*

## Additional visualizations and further analyses with the data

*Better give a more substantial title.*

### You may have subsections here or elsewhere

### However, subsections usually make sense when there is more than one

## Conclusion

*Topics like: What have we learned? How does it fit in or help in broader contexts? What remains open?*

## Interactive Visualization / Data Dashboard {.appendix}

*Either have this here or on another webpage (new quarto file).*

*Interactive visualizations may also appear above.* 

*The focus here is to provide the reader with sensible ways to explore the data independently. You have to think about what could be of interest.*




## Data Source {.appendix}

*If specific information and details about the data source would be too long in the "Outline" section, put it in an appendix section.* 

## Other appendix sections {.appendix}

*Do the same with other text which distracts the reading of the main text. *

## References {.unnumbered .appendix}
